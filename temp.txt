become
a
vital
skill
in
today’s

society

and

economy.

therefore,
important

to

teach

programming
in
early
stages
of
the
education.
since
learning
how

to
program
differs
from
other,
more
traditional
courses
in
schools,
an

application

oriented

approach

to

teaching

and

learning

is

required.

offers

the

possibility

to

students,
and

how

to

hands-on.

in

this

we
investigate
the
success
factors
that
need
to
be
satisfied
for

an

efficient

course

of

teaching

how

based
on
the
literature

we

were

able

to

identify

the
success

factors

for

and
the

introduction

in
the
last
years,
digitalization
has
become
a
worldwide
trend

that
transformed
the
way
societies
and
economies
function.
we

are

standing
at

the

beginning

of

the

4th

industrial

revolution

powered

by

the

internet

[1].

in

2002

about

1.6

million

–
information
technology
(it)
specialists
worked
in
the
it-sector

in
germany,
which
is
more
than
the
automobile
sector
and
the

mechanical
engineering
sector
combined
[2].
in
2014,
5.7%
of

the
private
sector
of
the
us
was
comprised
of
the
tech
industry,

totaling
to
about
6.5
million
workers
[3].
digitalization

has

changed

the

requirements

regarding

the

qualification

of

employees

by

raising
new

challenges

for

our

education
system.
more
than
70%
of
employer
searches
for
top

skilled

employees

on

employment-oriented

social

network

services,
such
as
linkedin
and
xing,
are
connected
to
it
skills,
e.g.
microsoft
office,
cloud
computing,
it,
and
programming
[4].
solving

complex

problems,

software

engineering,

programming,
and
being
able
to
familiarize
oneself
with
other

fields
of
science
have
become
key
skills
in
order
to
succeed
in
the

job

market.

being

able

to

program

is
a

valued

skill

for

various

jobs,

such

as

it

workers,

data

analysts,

designers,

engineers,
and

scientists
[5].
coding,
furthermore,
teaches

people
to
think
and
solve
problems
in
a
structured
way
[6].
this

underlines
the
argument
that
young
students
need
to
learn
how

to
code
early.
coding
has
become
the
new
literacy
of
the
21st

century
[7].
being
able
to
code
means
to
be
able
to
create,
model

and
execute
ideas
on
digital
devices
in
order
to
create
solutions

for
everyday
questions
and
problems
[6].
the
new
requirements
digitalization
puts
on
education
are

handled
differently
by

societies

all

over
the

world.
computer

science

has

found

its

way

into

universities

in

the

form

of

a

broader
range
of
computer
science
lectures,
and
lately
has
found
its
way
into
schools
as
well
[8,
9].
in
some
countries,
computer

science
classes
have
become
a
part
of
the
standard
education.
on

september
16,
2015,
the
mayor
of
new
york
city
announced
a

10-year

deadline

for
all

schools

in

new

york

city

to

offer

computer

science

classes

in

their

curriculum

[10].

another

example

is

the

uk

whose

government
has

published

a

new

curriculum
in
2013
that
includes
learning
how
to
program
[11].
as
we
live
in
a
post-modern
society,
digitalization
majorly

affects
young

adults
in

their

daily

lives

and

their

learning

behavior.

there

are

different

pedagogical

and

didactical

approaches
on
how
to
deal
with
the
changed
learning
behaviors.

the
traditional
approach
to
education
is
teacher-centered.
the

engagement
of
the
teacher
depends
upon
his
or
her
professional

identity:
the
way
the
teacher
relates
to
the
norms
and
values
of

the
profession

[12].
the

teacher’s
passion

for

his
job

and
his

quality

are
hence

educationally

important

for

the

learner’s

achievements
[13].
the
teacher-centered
approach
sets
teachers
and
their
abilities
as
the
corner
stone
to
students’
successes
[14].
nevertheless,
young

adults

in

our
post-modern

society

are

subject
to
the
impact
of
the
media
and
influences
of
the
internet.
young
adults
view
the
access
to
the
internet
as
a
substantial
part

of
their
society,
and
in
return
they
feel
“left
out”
if
not
involved
in
the
social
room
“internet”
[15].
studies
show
that
a
big
part

of
education
and
learning
happens
outside
of
the
classroom
[16].
young
adults,
especially,
use
the
internet
to
access
information,

the
online
media
thus
exerts
a
pedagogical
and
political
function

for
the
young
generation
[15].
the
importance
of
the
internet
as

an
“informal”
source
of
education
is
increasing
[17].
this

development

is

paired

with

the

content
of

our

educational

system

not

being

in

accordance

with
the

chaotic

reality
in
which
it
is
supposed
to
operate.
the
current
education

system
seems
to
no
longer
serve
society
or
its
current
economic

or
cultural
needs
as
it
opposes
everything
presupposed
by
these

needs
[18].
school
is
often
so
disconnected
from
real
life
and

unengaging
for
young
adults
that
they
cannot
stand
it
[18,
19].
prensky
[19]
noted
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
students
would
rather

turn
to
video
games
than
to
learning,
as
video
games
create
such

higher
levels
of
motivation,
engagement
and
satisfaction.

self-regulated
or
personalized
learning
is
recently
trending
in

the

academic

world

when

it

comes

to

newer

teaching

approaches.
the
theory
of
self-regulated
learning
is
that
when

students
become
engaged,
they
will
take
a
greater
responsibility

for
their
own
education
[20].
the
usage
of
the
self-regulatory

processes

has

shown

strong

correlations

with

high

academic

achievement
[20].
personalized

learning

aims
to

raise

standards

by

focusing

teaching
and
learning
on
the
aptitudes
and
interests
of
students.
it

develops
the

competence

and

confidence

of

each

learner

through

teaching

and

learning

strategies
that

build

on

their

individual

needs

[21].
personalized

learning

means

every

student

enjoying

curriculum

choice,

a

breadth

of

study,
and

personal
relevance,
with
clear
pathways
through
the
system
[21].
outside
of
our
schools,
the
young
generation
is
already
used

to
having
access
to
sophisticated
games
and
challenges,
which

they
voluntarily
choose
and
adapt
to
their
own
liking
and
skill.

this
generation
knows
what
kind
of
motivation
and
what
levels
of
engagement
are
possible,
however,
their
daily
lives,
and
more

specifically
their
school
systems,
often
do
not
provide
this
kind

of
motivation
or
engagement.
“video
games
are
the
epitome
of

this

kind

of

total

creative

engagement”
[19].
therefore,
our

educational
system

will

need

to

provide

more

engaging,

stimulating
scenarios
for
students
in
school.
ordered
by
the
british
government,
the
british
broadcasting

corporation
has
concluded
that
a
new
digital
curriculum
should

be
game-based
in
order
to
adequately
reach
and
engage
students
[19].

over

yet
the

[28].
therefore,
it
is
necessary
for
a

thorough

to

use

backward

[29]
in

to

consider
academic

within

scope
of

the

in

order

to

differentiate

between

relevant

and

irrelevant

papers

during

the

literature

review,

we

created

a

three-step

selection
process.
the
first
step
involved
evaluating
the
title
and

analysing
the
abstract
in
combination
with
the
keywords
listed

above.

the

second

step

consisted

of

evaluating

the

table

of

content
for
relevant
chapters
–
given
that
the
contribution
had
a

table
of
contents.
the
third
step
was
reading
the
full
article,
in

order
to
decide
on
its
relevance
to
the
topic.
by
this
kind
of
filter

and
selection
process
we
were
able
to
dismiss
irrelevant
papers

as

well

as

identify

key

articles

concerning

the

scope

of

this

paper.
the
selection
process
was
supported
by
the
following
list

of
relevant
topics
(table
ii.
):
after

the

initial

literature

search,
31

key

sources

were

identified.
the
relevant
results
in
connection
with
the
databases

and
the
initial

can
be
seen
in
table

those

do

not

include

the

found

by

searches.
after
conducting
the
backward
search,
a
forward
search
was

conducted,
using
the
sources
found
in
the
initial
literature
review

as

well
as

in

the
backward

search.

after

an
evaluation
of
the

articles’
contents,
meaning
to
analyze
their
titles,
abstracts,
and

sometimes
full
texts
[27],
we
were
able
to
identify
24
relevant

by
the

furthermore,
16
articles
were

identified

by

the

the

be
a
result
of

results
in
the
following
chapter,
an
evaluation
is
given
of
different

success
factors
and
theses
stated
by
previous
authors,
based
on

the
71
relevant
sources
identified
by
the
literature
search.
not

every
paper
found
in
the
literature
search
will
be
cited
as
some

ideas

appear

in

multiple

articles,
but

often

with

a

different

approach
or
in
another
fashion.
in

the

following,
we

present

some

exceptional

ideas

and

papers
found
during
the
literature
search.
the
idea
underlying

edutainment

is

to

promote

learning

by

merging

educational

contents
and
entertainment
activities
that
increase
engagement,

emotion
and
motivation
[31].
the
problem
of
motivating
students
in
doing
the
assigned

tasks
[32]
is
one
broadly
discussed,
but
so
far
no
final
“fit-for-
all”
solution
was
found.
it
is
doubtful
whether
there
will
ever
be

one

single

solution,

but

the

playful

approach

offers

some

techniques
to
reach,
engage,
and
motivate
a
wider
audience
of

students

than

traditional

methods.

one

of

the

case

studies

involving
edutainment
indicates
that
students
find
a
game
more

motivating
than
paper
exercises
[33].
additionally,
the
majority

of
the
students
also
perceived
the
game
of
the
case
study
to
have

a
higher
learning
effect
than
paper
exercises
or
textbook
reading

[33].
the
potential
of
games
and
simulations
in
the
context
of

adult
training
and
education
was
called
‘striking’
by
o'neil,
et

al.
[34].

conversely,
there

have

been
papers
published

which

claim

one

of

the

most

crucial

factors

of

learning

to

be

the

competencies,

knowledge,
and

beliefs

of

the

teacher

[35].
teacher-centered

approaches

have

by

now

almost

achieved

a

traditional

status,

even

the

individuality
and
diverse
potential
in
students,
while
focusing

solely
on
the
ability
of
the
teacher.

they

often

neglect

though

in

contrast,
other

authors

based

the

teacher’s

importance

exclusively
on
their
role
of
facilitating
and
supporting
learners

[36].

education

may

depend

on

the

teacher’s

knowledge

and

capabilities,
but

there

are

other

critical

factors

to

take

into

account
as
well.
it
may
be
just
as,
if
not
more
important
to
look

at
the
individual
students
and
the
environment
created
to
support

their
learning
process,
especially
considering
that
information
is

freely
available
and
easily
accessible
nowadays.
the
potential
of

games
in
higher
education
has
been
recognized
for
a
long
time,

both
for
increasing
motivation
and
for
enabling
other
types
of

learning
experiences,
than
those
offered
by
traditional
teaching

methods

[33].
before

the

internet
and
the
possibility

of

rapid

knowledge
acquisition,
the
teacher
was
the
main
source
of
new

knowledge.
in
the
age
of
technology,
the
teacher
does
not
need

to
transfer
information
anymore
but
facilitates
learning
in
a
way

that
the

learners

enhance

their

knowledge

on

their

own,

for

instance

through

the

active

manipulation

and

construction

of

objects
[31].
this
learning
by
doing
aspect
is
supported
by
a
case

study

in

programming

courses,
finding

out

that

without

extensively
practicing
it
is
not
possible
to
score
excellent
grades
except

by

having

moderate

to

extensive

experience

already

before

the

course

[32].

another

case

study

noted,
that

while

students
show
enthusiasm
for
a
course
with
a
playful
learning

approach,

involvement

of

mentors,

continuous

feedback

and

critique
sessions
were
critical
to
drive
the
project
[31].
hence,
it
is
maybe
not
the
beliefs
and
knowledge
of
teachers,
which
are

important,
but

their

capability

to

support

and

facilitate

the

hunger
for
knowledge
in
students.

summarizing
we
can
underline
that
while
teachers
do
have

a
role
in
the
grand
scheme
of
student’s
learning,
that
role
is
not

central
anymore.

the

access

to

unbiased

information

and

background
knowledge
offered
by
countless
instantly
accessible

sources
has
never
been
as
easy
as
today.
by
implementing
the

playful

teaching

and

learning

approach

the

emphasis

of

the

teacher’s

job

shifts

towards

supporting

and

facilitating

the

progress
students
make
while
working
independently
on
their

own
projects.
the
focus
is
on
the
environment
of
the
learning

process
and
the
support
system
provided
for
students.
hence,
the

success
factors
found
are
not
about
what
makes
teachers
good
at

their
job,
but
what
factors
they
have
to
satisfy,
to
pave
the
way

for
an
effective
and
adaptive
learning
process
in
their
students.

to

success
factors
in
teaching
how
to

iv.
for
teaching
in
general,
we
recognized
four
success
factors.
not

taken

into

account,
as

a

success

factor

for

the

teaching

process

is

the

teacher’s

ability

to

educate,

his

attitude

and

motivation
as
well
as
his
pedagogical
and
subject
knowledge.

some

of

these
may

actually

be

a

success

factor

according

to

hubwieser
et

al.

[35],

however,
there

have

been

other
papers

published
calling
the
role
of
the
teacher
mainly
a
facilitator
of

learning
[31,
36].
as
the
goal
of
this
thesis
was
not
to
examine

what
makes
teachers
good
or
excellent
at
their
job
but
to
analyze

and
highlight
the
most
critical
success
factors
of
teaching
how

to

program,

this

thesis

focuses

on

success

factors

in

the

classroom,
concerning
structure,
environment
and
the
student.
a.
motivation
motivation
and
its
reasons
differ
and
reflect
the
"variation
of

individual
differences"
[37].
motivation
is
the
attitude,
behavior

and

study
practice

[38]
behind

acquiring

new

knowledge.

a
study,
analyzing
teacher
narratives
dealing
with
frustration
and

success
in
facilitating
learning
in
their
students,
showed
that
the

outcome
of
any
task
we
take
on
is
influenced
by
the
background

knowledge
and
prior
experience
[38],
which
directly
results
in

the

motivation

to

learn

more

about

it.

there

are

two

general

types
of
motivation
–
intrinsic
and
extrinsic.
intrinsic
motivation

is
based
on
self-interest
while
extrinsic
motivation
comes
from

the
outside,
for
instance
in
expectancy
to
get
a
reward,
money
or

good
grades
in
school.
extrinsic
motivators
might
even
diminish

one’s
interest
in
learning
if
they
are
not
supported
by
intrinsic

factors
because
the
goal
becomes
the
reward
not
learning
itself

and

hence

the

motivation

is

short-term

while

reducing

the

inclination
of
pursuing
the
subject
after
the
reward
is
achieved

[39,
40].
intrinsic
motivation,
simply
put,
appears
if
the
learner

sees

doing

something

as

fun

and

enjoyable,

therefore

he

is

inclined
to
do
more
of
it.

techniques,
to
use
exploratory
environments,
to
give
the
learner

personal
control
over
the
progress
he
makes
and
to
challenge
the

learner
while
arousing
his
curiosity.
a
4-year
study,
involving

178

students

at

a

university

in

taiwan,
showed

that

intrinsic

motivation
and
therefore
engaging
in
learning
behaviors
result

in
academic
success
and
better
test
performance
than
motivation

based
on
extrinsic
rewards
[41].
however,
another
study
about

students’
learning

successes

and

failures

noted

that

the

motivation

and

the

students’
stance

towards
a
certain

topic

is

mutable,
something
that
students
can
change
about
themselves
[38].
this

internal

process

of

changing

the

opinion

of

the

students
for
the
better
must
be
supported
and
facilitated
by
their
educators.

hence,
our

first

success

factor

to

teaching

is

to

motivate
the
students
intrinsically
for
the
subject
matter
at
hand.

robert
fried
explained
it
in
his
book
"the
passionate
teacher"

as
the
teacher
setting
the
example
for
his
students:
"the
example

we

set

as

passionate

adults

allows

us

to

connect

to

young

people’s
minds
and
spirits
that
can
have
a
lasting
positive
impact

on

their

lives."

[42].

the

traditional

classroom
activities

are

exceeded
if
the
teacher
shows
passion
for
his
subject
[43]
and
is

able
to
pass
this
passion
on
to
his
students.
the
best
staffed
and

equipped
school
in
the
country
cannot
successfully
exercise
its

potential
to
educate
if
the
students
attending
it
aren’t
motivated

to
learn
about
what
it
has
to
offer.
the
aforementioned
4-year

study
further
noted
that,
within
context,
the
students’
learning

motivation

and

engagement

behaviors

are

key

to

improving

teaching

as

well

as

learning

[41].

a

study

about

students’
motivation

showed

a

relationship

between

the

students’
expectancy,

values

and

the

deep

information

processing

approach,

however,
it

was

not

able

to

link

those

factors

to

academic

achievement

[44].

this

shows

that

there

are

other

factors
to
take
into
account
next
to
motivation.

b.
environment
the

our
second
success
factor
is
closely
connected
to
our
first
–

and

[45].
learners
need
to

be

actively

engaged

and

be
given
the
opportunity

for

cooperative,

collaborative

and

independent

learning

[36].
conolly

et

al.

[39]
noted

that

for

an

effective

learning

environment
the
learners
need
to
be
allowed
to
develop
their

own
process
to
reach
a
solution,
they
should
be
encouraged
to

take
responsibility
for
learning
and
they
should
be
motivated,

engaged

and

challenged

by

learning

environment.

robertson
and
howells
[36]
further
describe
how
the
tasks
have

to
be
adapted
to
individual
needs
to
support
the
learner.
the

educator

is

in

traditional

teaching

styles

the

main

source

of

information

and

knowledge

transfer,

yet

the

environment

facilitates

the

learning

process

by

providing

support

with

mediums.
the
age
of
technology
gives
students
the
opportunity

of
unlimited
access
to
knowledge
online
and
the
teacher’s
role

consequently
shifts
from
the
source
of
information
to
enabler
and
creator
of
the
optimal
learning
environment
[31,
36].
this

begins
with
simple
things
such
as
a
classroom
and
a
whiteboard

but

continues

to
technological

devices,

classrooms

equipped

the

with
projectors
or
computers
for
the
students,
leading
up
to
a

supporting

network

of

colleagues

and

faculty

members

in

which
open
communication
is
possible.
alton-lee
[46]
found

that
in
order
to
learn
effectively
and
remember
long-term,
the

amount
of
opportunities
to
learn
and
to
come
into
contact
with

the
material
are
vital.
the
aim
is
to
create
an
environment
where

ideas

can

be

refined,

evaluated

and

given
appropriate

future

directions
[31]
in
order
to
support
and
widen
the
educational

aspect.
the
environment
not
only
fosters
effective
learning
but

also
provides
the
chance
of
involving
the
student,
providing
the

opportunity
for
open
interaction
and
helping
students
beyond

the
classroom.
helping
students
connect
the
course
material
to

life
beyond
the
classroom
and
using
real
world
examples
assists

the

learning

process

immensely.

this

is

based

on

the

presumption
that
students
have
opportunities
to
learn
outside
of

class

[46].
the

use

and

manipulation

of

the

environment

are

critical
for
the
learning
success.
alton-lee
[47]
further
wrote

that

to

create

a

caring

and

inclusive

cohesive

learning

community
means
not
only
to
offer
knowledge
but
to
interact

and

involve

the

students.

brian

crose

[48]
formulated

it

this

way:
to
make
any
student
successful,
it
is
important
to
provide

a

classroom

environment

that

is

inviting

and

encourages

students
to
be
engaged
in
their
own
learning.
c.
integration
and
involvement

our
next
success
factor
is
the
integration
and
involvement
of

the
students.
this
success
factor
can
be
summarized
as
two
sides

of
the
same
coin:
the
first
one
is
provided
by
the
teacher
and
the

environment,
the
possibility

for
students
to
contribute
to
their

own

education

[48].

the

second

one

is

dependent

on

the

students’
motivation,
self-involvement
and
active
participation.

the
students’
participation
in
the
lessons,
in
their
own
education

and
in
classroom
activities
is
an
effective
method
for
enhancing

learning
[49].
increasing
engagement
of
the
student
is
a
success

factor

for

an

effective

learning

process

[31].

integrating

the

student

and

involving

them

in

the

process

of

learning

means

letting
the
students
take
their
education
into
their
own
hands
and

look
outside
the
box,
based
on
their
own
interests.
learning
by

doing
is
a
practice
applied
often
not
only
for
higher
academic

education
but
also
in
almost
every
aspect
of
our
lives.
a
case

study

of

learning

programming

by

actively

programming

supported

studying

programming
as
one
of
the
most
influential
factors
to
learning
[32].
the
only
exceptions
were
the
students
"who
had
moderate

to
extensive
programming
experience
already
before
the
course"

[32].
involving

the

students

in

the

curriculum

and

classroom

activities
such
as
group
work
or
discussions,
whether
by
hands-
on

methods

or

by

theoretical

work,

is,
therefore,
our

third

success
factor.
d.
interaction
the

“learning-by-doing”
aspect

of

our
last
success
factor
is
the
interaction,
formal
as
well
as

informal,

between

student

and

teacher

and

the

optimally

continuous

feedback

the

student

receives.

in

the

classroom

be

often

not

difficult

to

give

the

–
even

feedback
can
be
perceived
as

and

feedback
does
not
trust

or
like
the
feedback
giver.
in
order
to
create
a
non-threatening

and

friendly

environment

the

teacher

should

utilize

a

large

portion
of
the
first
class
session
to
allow
students
to
get
to
know

each
other
as
well
as
allow
for
informal
interactions
between
the

students

and

faculty

members

[48].

the

basis

of

the

teacher-
student

relationship

should

not

be

out

of

necessity

in

the

classroom

but

a

voluntary

support

system

provided

by

the

faculty
and
the
staff
at
the
schools
and
university
to
foster
the

success

of

students.

education.

the

teacher’s

individual

response

to

the

students’
difficulties
is
a
central
aspect
of
learning
[38].
the
traditional

teaching
styles
are
mostly
teacher-centered
and
hence
they
often

constrain

the

possibility

of

perspectives

important

to

make

rather

than

passive

[49].
classroom
discussions
are
critical
to
the
learning

process
of
all
students
[48]
but
are
only
possible
if
the
student

feels
he
is
allowed
to
freely
think
out
loud
and
interact
with
the

faculty.
the
responsibility
for
the
interaction
is,
therefore,
again

two
sided.
on
the
one
hand,
the
teachers
have
a
responsibility
to

structure

the

environment

and

present

the

subject

matter

well

[38]
and
to
foster
the
ability
to
think
critically
[49]
by
asking

critical
or
thoughtful
questions.
on
the
other
hand,
students
have

a
responsibility
to
engage
and
interact
for
the
sake
of
their
own

education.

factor.

conversely,
the

teacher

is

in

this

scenario

not

a

central

role,

but

again
solely

a

supporter

and

enabler,
by
giving
feedback.
feedback
about
the
student’s
effort

is
usually
provided
in
two
possible
ways:
by
free
interactions

and
discussions
in
the
classroom
or
by
regular
assessments
in

the

form

of

oral

or

written

exams.

exams

and

similar

assessments

for

the

purpose

of

making

judgments

about

the

current
state
of
affairs
[53]
are
important
to
control
the
overall

progress
of
the
learners,
however,
continuous
feedback
provided

by
the
educator
not
only
in
the
form
of
graded
events
but
also

during
discussions
and
unrestrained
interaction
is
crucial
to
the

learning
success.

playful

approach
for
the

approach
to

five

success

factors

have

been

identified.

three

factors

overlap

with

the

success

factors
for
teaching
how
to
program
in
general
and
two
of
them

are

specific

to

the

playful

approach.

the

environment

factor

was

not

transferred

from

the

success

factors

for

teaching

in

general
as
the
main
part
of
the
learning
environment
is
created

by

the

game,

which

is

environment

and

teacher

at

the

same

time.

the

game

itself

hence

also

plays

a

critical

role

in

the

teaching
process.
the
factors
can
be
satisfied
in
numerous
ways

which
gives
reason
to
the
hypothesis
that
there
is
no
one-fits-all
solution

when

it

comes

to

games

being

successful

in

pedagogical
contexts.
in
conclusion,
the
games
developed
for

educational
usage
need
to
satisfy
the
success
factors
just
as
the

traditional
lectures
would.
this
can
be
seen
in
success
factors

like

“interaction

and
feedback”
and

“integration

and
involvement”
in

the

gameplay.

next

to

the

three

factors

in

general

–
“motivation”,
transferred

“integration
and
involvement”,
and
“interaction
and
feedback”
we
were
able

to

identify

two

success

factors

specific

to

the

playful
approach
–
adaption
to
the
audience
and
the
integration

of
the
educational
content

into
gameplay.

nevertheless,
even

for

the

success

factors,

which
overlap,
the

playful

teaching

approach
offers
some
new
ways
of
satisfying
them.
a.
motivation
teaching

from

motivation
and
the
enthusiasm
for
learning
is
again
our
first

success
factor.
the
motivation
of
students
is
changeable
[38]
and

the

playful

teaching

approach

uses

games

in

order

to

motivate
students
for
the
topic
at
hand.
iglesias
and
gálvez
[54]
claimed
that
even
if
students
neither
need
nor
expect
learning

to
be
fun
or
engaging,
which
they
did
not
think
to
be
completely

true,
video
games
and
virtual
reality
are
valuable
tools
for
those

students

to

get

motivated

and

engage

in

difficult

and

maybe

initially
boring
subjects.
this
claim

was
supported
by
a
case

study

comparing
learning

effectiveness

of

gameplay

with

traditional

paper

exercises

and

book

reading,

showing

that

games
are
more
motivating
and
have
a
higher
learning
effect

perceived
by
the
students
[33].
intrinsic
motivation
is
based
on

four
critical
individual
factors
which
differ
for
each
person:
the

challenge

and

imagination,

curiosity

for

the

unknown

and

personal

control

over
the
situation
[55].
these
factors
can
directly
be
applied
to

the
goals
of
developing
video
games
as
well.
video
games
are

a
popular
tool
to
pass
the
time
and
to
enjoy
ourselves,
as
video

games

are

developed

with

the

main

goal

to

keep

players

interested

and

playing

for

a

long

time.

even

from

a

psychological
standpoint,
motivation
can
be
enhanced
by
using

game

techniques

[40].

this

"joy

of

playing"

is
used

in

the

playful
teaching
approach
to
motivate
students
to
learn
about

new
subjects.

games

motivate
us
to

are

[56].
the
brilliance
in
games
is
that
they
convince
us
that
we

actually
want
to
do
tasks
that
seem
to
be
unpleasant
on
their
own.

mcgonigal
[56]
chose
the
game
“chore
wars”
as
an
example:

players

earn

virtual

gold

and

experience

for

completing

household
tasks
which
are
usually
dreaded
–
like
cleaning
the

bathroom

or

washing

the

dishes.

by

implementing

a

better

reward
system
than
“just”
a
clean
house
and
by
gamification
of

the
chores

players
(or
in
this
case
the
household
members)

are
motivated
to
do
unpleasant
tasks.

traditional

teaching

methods

offer

limited

possibilities

to

involve

the

students,

however

playing

an

educational

game

means
for
students
to
become
active
participants
in
their
own

education.

papastergiou

[57]
observed

during

a

case

study,
using
educational
games,
that
students
“seemed
very
absorbed

and

interested

in

the

task,

and

exhibited

high

levels

of

engagement”
while
playing.
the
shift
from
the
passive
recipient

to
an
active
integrated
partner
in
the
learning
process
is
a
key

factor
in
the
playful
learning
approach,
as
it
means
involving

the

student

in

the

forced

"beat

and
to

interact

with
the

from
sitting
at
the
back
of
the

class,
listening
to
the
teacher

a
dialogue
with
few
of
the

students,
every

student
optimally
sits
in

of
their
own

learning
by
playing
a
game
that
is

provides.
c.
adaption
to
the
audience
games
are
often
focused
on
a
specific
audience,
based
on

their

difficulty,

on

their

level

of

violence,

bad

language

and

general
content.
educational
games
follow
the
same
principle.

based
on
its
educational
content
and
difficulty
to
play,
as
well

as
their
curriculum,
they
target
different
audiences.
therefore,

our

second

success

factor

is

for

the

game

and

the

teaching

approach
to
be
adjusted
to
the
audience.
this
is
often
very
hard

to
achieve
as
it
connects

game
developers,
who
often
have

limited
knowledge
about
teaching,
with
experienced
educators

who,
in
return,
often
have
limited
or
no
knowledge
about
game

design.
under
optimal
circumstances,
the

be
easy
to

understand
and
to
play
for
a

audience
of
human
players

[60].
the
introduction
to
the
gameplay
needs
to
be
clear
and

shouldn’t

need

further

specifications

[61]
so

students

do
not
have
to
read
many
pages
of
the
manual
first
but
can
directly

start

playing.

furthermore

"the

content

has

to

[62].

can

either

be

to

(pre-school,
elementary

university)
or
limited
to
a
single
class
in

to

its

curriculum.

the

adaption

to

the

audience

needs

to

be

individualized

according

to

students

with

of

[63].

while

but

still

–
schools
often

operate
at
the
lowest
common
denominator

[65,
cited
in
66].
this
means
that
a
lot
of
potential
at
the
more
capable
and
higher

end
of
the
class
concerning
learning
and
motivational
aspects
often

gets

lost

in

sometimes

feel

bored

or

even
annoyed
by
having
to
listen
to,
in
their
opinion,
“stupid

questions”

of

other

students,

which
lag

behind.

games

can

counteract
this
phenomenon
by
interacting
on
an
individual
and

personal

level,

adapted

to

each

student’s
specific

needs.

educational
games
achieve
this
by
setting
difficulty
levels
for

the
gameplay
itself
and
giving
the
student
the
opportunity
to

self-regulate

the

speed,

difficulty

of

advancing

through

the

game
and
educational
content
independent
from
other
students

or

the

teacher.

the

audience-centered

approach

of

playful

teaching
and
learning
helps
to
adapt
the
game
to
the
individual

needs
of
the
students
and
their
education,
in
order
to
make
it

interesting
and
fun
to
play.
games
hence
address
the
mismatch

of

the

increasing

behavioral

controls

and

the

decreasing

complexity
of
cognitive
tasks
in
schools,
by
providing
engaging

and
complex
learning-by-doing
environments
which
are
easily

adjustable
to
individuals
[67].
games
are
sometimes
only
seen

as
a
tool
whose
purpose
is
making
learning
easier
[68]
but
this

often

leads

to

neglecting

the

gameplay

experience

which

the

students
undergo.
a
game
that
is
seen
only
as
a
tool,
a
means

and
not
as
an
end
cannot
provide
a
satisfying
experience
as
the

whole
reason
to
why
we
play
games
is
as
an
end.
hence
not

only
the
curriculum
but
also
the
game
itself
has
to
be
audience-
centered,
not
only
in
perspective
to
its
difficulty
and
challenges

but
also
in
the
overall
experience.
d.
interaction
and
feedback
we

mentioned

the

success

factor

of

giving

feedback

and

enhancing
the
interaction
between
students
and
the
educational

content

before

as

a

vital

aspect

of

teaching

in

general.

this

success
factor
is
also
our
third
out
of
five
transferred
factors

(next

to

motivation
and

involvement)

which

come

into

play

when

teaching

with

educational

games.

edutainment

has

to

allow
for
communication
between
the
player
and
the
game,
as
well
as
the
exchange
of
knowledge
to
encourage
playing
and

learning
[60].
one
of
the
design
goals
and
principles
of
teaching

and
learning
programming
via
interactive
gaming
is
that
"the

games

need

to

be

interactive

and

the

interactions

need

to

be

iterative
and
involve
multiple
rounds.
the
player’s
interactions

with
the
game
should
not
be
just
one
round
of
interaction"
[61].
this
can
be
implemented
in
learning
how
to
program
by
giving

the
player
the
possibility
to
alter
his
own
code
after
receiving

feedback.

were
able
to
identify

the
success
factors
for
teaching
how
to
program
in
general,
as

well

as

the

success

factors

to

our

second

research

question:
teaching
how
to
program
with
a
playful
approach.
we
were
able

to

identify

four

success

factors

for

general

teaching:

the

motivation

of

learning

environment,
the
integration
and
involvement
of
the
students
in

the
learning
process,
and
the
interaction
between
students
and

faculty.
supporting

students,
the

the

similarly,
five
success
factors
for
teaching
how
to
program
with
a
playful
approach
have
been
identified:
the
motivation,
the
integration
and
involvement
in
class,
the
audience-centered

focus,
giving
feedback
and
enhancing
interaction,
and
the
fluent

integration
of
the
educational
content
into
the
gameplay.
some

of

these

factors

are

interconnected,

as

for

example

a

student

won't
engage
a
subject
and
cannot
be
integrated
and
involved
if

he
is
not
motivated
to
do
so.
in
contrast,
feedback
is
not
based

on
other
factors,
but
can
and
should
be
given
at
any
time.
as

stated

before,

the

teacher

is

not

solely

responsible

for

the

motivation

of

the

students

as

motivation

is

best

applied

if

intrinsic

and

not
solely
extrinsic.

however,

the

teacher

is

responsible

for

creating

a

learning

environment,

giving

feedback

and

allowing

interaction
to

support

the

students’
initial
curiosity,
fostering
it
to
becoming
the
motivation
to
look

outside
the
box,
to
recognize
learning
as
something
fun.
the

literature

review’s

only

limitation

was

that

it

was

performed
in
a
relatively
new
field.
while
teaching
has
been

discussed
for
a
long
time,
teaching
with
a
playful
approach
and

are
new

hence,
the
literature
review’s

timeframe

is

relatively

short

compared

to

other

fields

of

science.
in
the
future,
it
will
be
important
to
implement
these

factors

in

connection

with

the

playful

teaching

approach

in

controlled

surroundings

to

validate

them,

while

determining

whether
there
are
additional
factors
which
have
not
been
taken

into
account
or
have
been
neglected.
a
first
attempt
at
this
will

be

performed

by

carrying

out

a

case

study

at

a

technical
secondary
school
in
